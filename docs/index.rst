mozbase
=======

Mozbase (normally written as `mozbase` except at the beginning of a
sentence) is a set of easy to use python libraries designed to be used
in the creation of automated testing software. It is used at least to some
degree by all of Mozilla's test harnesses including Talos_, mochitest_,
reftest_, Peptest_ and Eideticker_.
